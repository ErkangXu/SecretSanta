Secret Santa is a way for a group of friends, family members, or co-workers to exchange gifts.  
The tricky part in this problem is to prevent a person getting the present from himself/herself.
If there are two present left and one of them was sent out by the last person in
the list, then the second last person has to be given that present. Otherwise the 
last person will get the present that he/she bought.
